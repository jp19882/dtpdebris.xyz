      <div style="font-size: 1vw; line-height: 1.1vw"; class = "splashHeader">dtpdebris.xyz is an interactive debris field of virtual objects that were collected or produced by students in Southern California Institute of Architecture’s Design Theory + Pedagogy program. From left to right, the x-axis delineates a spectrum of didactic-dialectical, factual-fictional, or critical-speculative models of architectural pedagogy that are mapped onto a y-axis timeline starting from September 7th, 2021, at the top, to September 7th, 2022, at the bottom. As you navigate the space, you will encounter various constituencies, floating aphorisms, representations, histories, and narratives that can either reinforce or challenge the pedagogical landscape of architecture today. Rather than immediately try to pick up these pieces, now may be the time to appropriately acknowledge their nonlinearity, fragmentation, and incompleteness as representing what is actually a debris field of many voices, ideas, and values...</div>

At the moment of our departure from this union, we begin the perpetual act of constructing our identity.  Lacan also states, “identity is born of an interaction between the self and others.”</p>

But underlying the theme of post-studio and post-genius pedagogy was a remystification of design method that emptied out the workshop and filled it with a space for reflection that demanded no products and enforced no labor upon the students.</p>

This opinion is often aligned with the architectural profession and the building sciences which have an epistemological basis rooted in measurable compliance and quantifiable performance data. The second position, which is what founded the FSA, is that architecture happens under the right circumstances. The ambiguity inherent in this pedagogical position is the logical inversion of the professional and scientific practice of architecture that cordones off of the discipline to the fine arts or social equity.</p>
